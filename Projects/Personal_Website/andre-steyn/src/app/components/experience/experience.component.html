        <p class="">
          Join me on my journey at Dariel Software, a prominent software
          consulting firm in Johannesburg, specializing in software development,
          integration, technology consulting, and digital transformation. They
          excel in creating tailored software solutions, managing the entire
          development lifecycle, and seamlessly connecting applications and data
          sources.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          As a Junior Software Developer, my role at Dariel has been dynamic and
          challenging. I started my journey by being assigned to a private
          hospital company as a client. Here, I delved into the existing project
          by writing unit tests, gaining a deeper understanding of its
          functionality. Subsequently, I contributed to a CMS project by
          extending the functionality of the FHIR API, enhancing its
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          My role further evolved as I took on different responsibilities,
          focusing on resolving critical bugs in the main application, ensuring
          its reliability and performance. The journey culminated as I took the
          lead in getting an inherited Angular application up and running,
          working collaboratively with the team to address and overcome numerous
          challenges.

          During my initial role at Minopex, I spearheaded a significant project
          investigating the efficiency of dense medium cyclones and optimizing
          ferrosilicon recovery, contributing to cost-effective process
          enhancements.

          My collaboration with the junior metallurgist involved innovative data
          analysis techniques to improve accuracy in flotation cell data
          management. Additionally, I demonstrated strong written communication
          skills in preparing various reports and documents, actively engaged in
          continuous improvement initiatives, upheld safety standards, and
          leveraged advanced Excel and Python expertise to streamline data
          analysis and reporting processes.

          During my second stint of vacation work at Minopex, I played an active
          role in optimizing the flotation section's operations.

          My responsibilities encompassed tasks like airflow optimization,
          reagent preparation, and maintaining uninterrupted flow in pipelines.
          My primary project involved conducting bench flotation tests and
          in-depth particle size distribution analysis, utilizing established
          methodologies to evaluate their influence on process efficiency.
          Additionally, I leveraged Excel and Python for meticulous data
          analysis and interpretation, thereby improving the effectiveness of
          data-driven decision-making and making significant contributions to
          our team's objectives.
