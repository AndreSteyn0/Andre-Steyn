            >Join me on my journey at Dariel Software,</span
          >
          a prominent software consulting firm in Johannesburg, specializing in
          software development, integration, technology consulting, and digital
          transformation. They excel in creating tailored software solutions,
          managing the entire development lifecycle, and seamlessly connecting
          applications and data sources.

        <p class="">
          <span class="font-bold">As a Junior Software Developer,</span>
          my role at Dariel has been dynamic and challenging. I started my
          journey by being assigned to a private hospital company as a client.
          Here, I delved into the existing project by writing unit tests,
          gaining a deeper understanding of its functionality. Subsequently, I
          contributed to a CMS project by extending the functionality of the
          FHIR API, enhancing its capabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <span class="font-bold"
            >My role further evolved as I took on different
            responsibilities,</span
          >

          focusing on resolving critical bugs in the main application, ensuring
          its reliability and performance. The journey culminated as I took the
          lead in getting an inherited Angular application up and running,
          working collaboratively with the team to address and overcome numerous
          challenges.
